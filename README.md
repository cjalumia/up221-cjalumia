# UP221: Conrad Alumia
My name is **Conrad Alumia** and I am a first-year MURP student. My concentration is Transportation Policy and Planning and I am pursuing the Urban Design & Mobility certificate. I am interested in transportation equity, pedestrian planning, public transit, and public spaces. Outside of school, my hobbies include music (marching band!), theme parks, traveling, dancing, and running. I also recently started taking boxing classes!
# Research Project Ideas
I would be interested in studying variations in bus station, such as which stations have shelters and any potential relationships to ridership demographics. I am also interested in examining transit access, sidewalk obstructions, and pedestrian safety.
